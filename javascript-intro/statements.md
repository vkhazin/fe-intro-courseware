# Statements

* In a programming language statement is a command to be executed by a computer
* Commands perform actions, e.g. command prints a text: `console.log('Hello World');`
* Where `console` is a tool provided by the JavaScript language to access debugging console, we will discuss later...
* And `log()` is a command to print a something out to the console, in our case a text: `Hello World`
* Text, or as will call it from now on a string, must be surrounded with single quotes `''` or double quotes `" "`
* String, in programming, is a sequence of letters, digits and special characters such as comma, question mark and etc.
* At the end of the statement, there is a semicolon `;` to indicate the end of a statement 
* In JavaScript the semicolon is optional for a single line statement, the common practice is to use it
* In case of multiple statements on the same line semicolon is required: 
* `console.log('Hello'); console.log(' '); console.log('World'); console.log('!');`
* Above will execute 4 statements from one line of code from JavaScript perspective
