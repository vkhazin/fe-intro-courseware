* In addition to Html tags, we have covered previously, there are also [attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
* An attribute modifies the appearance of an Html element type
* Example:`<table border="1px">` where `border` is an attribute with the value `1px` for element `table`
* Border attribute will add a border around the table and between every table cell
* Style attribute can be added to any HTML element e.g. `<p style="color:green">This is a paragraph.</p>`
* Attribute names do not tolerate spaces, you will find some attributes look like two words together, e.g.: [readonly](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_readonly.asp)
