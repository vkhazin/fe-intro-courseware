# CSS Syntax

[![](../.gitbook/assets/css-syntax.gif)](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_css.asp)

* Syntax is an arrangement of words and characters to create well-formed sentences in a language, human or computer
* Above is an example of the syntax to decorate `h1` Html tag and it will be applied to all `h1` elements
* This is called _**CSS Element Selector**_: an instruction to a web browser to decorate Html elements
* A different approach is to define a CSS class, a set of design features and to reference it explicitly
* ```text
  CSS:
  .centeredHeader {
    color: green;
    font-size: 20pxl;
    margin: auto
  }

  Html:
  <h2 class="centeredHeader">The Cradle of Humankind</h2>
  ```
* This is _**CSS Class Selector**_ that applies a style on Html elements referencing CSS class name
* Another approach is a style that applies to an element with attribute `id` equal to the style class name:
* ```text
  CSS:
  #italicText {
    color: red;
  }

  Html:
  <p id="italicText">A text rendered italic</p>
  ```
* This is called **CSS id Selector** that applies the style based on the `id` attribute value
* There are more [CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp), we will limit our quest to the three above for now..
