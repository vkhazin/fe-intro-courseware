# Functions

![](../assets/function.png)

* A function is a group of statements for a specific task, e.g. adding two numbers
* Provides a way to create reusable code blocks
* Makes easier to eliminate errors and to modify code
* `addNumbers` is a name of the function
* `a, b` are parameters or arguments passed when calling the function
* `return` is a special word returning a value to a caller of the function
* Function statements are surrounded by `{` and `}` 
* Calling the function uses the following syntax: `addNumbers(1, 2);`
* We write functions once and we reuse it twice from the example above
