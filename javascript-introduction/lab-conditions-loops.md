# Lab: Conditions & Loops

1. Navigate to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) and login if required
2. Create a new repl and select JavaScript template for it, provide a name `lab-js-conditions-loops`
3. In the middle pane, you will be writing JavaScript code
4. The `run` button on the top will execute your JavaScript
5. In the right pane, you will see the result of code execution
6. This lab will not provide detailed instructions instead there are links to documentation and online reference to learn from
7. No programmer can succeed without getting used to looking for documentation and examples online 
8. In the code pane declare a variable with any legal name and assign a numeric value to it
9. Use `if` statement to compare the value of the variable to a number of your choosing
10. When the value is greater than the variable's value print out, using `console.log`, the following text: 'the number is greater than the variable value'
11. Otherwise print 'the value is not greater than the variable value', you will need to learn how to use [else](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/javascript-if-else-statements.php) statement to achieve the desired behaviour we did not know before as it frequently happens when you program
12. Use `run` button to execute your code and resolve issues, if any, reported
13. Once verified the results, clear the code pane to start over
14. Declare a new variable `let a = 0;`
15. Define a loop using `for` statement to increment the variable `a` until it reaches a value of `10`
16. Print the value of `a` using `console.log` inside the loop
17. Print the value of `a` using `console.log` when the loop has finished
18. Once verified the results, clear the `for` loop
19. Re-create the loop with `while` loop to achieve the same result
20. Then re-create the loop with `do...while` loops to the achieve the same result
21. How the behaviout of `while` loop different from `do..while` loop
