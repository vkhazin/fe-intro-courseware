# What's a Programming Language

* Similarly to a human written language: its a vocabulary and a set of rules to write instructions to a computer
* A programming language comes with its ready-to-use components, kind-of a pencil case with pencils, pens and erasers
* Most programming languages are textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation
* Learning a programming language is memorizing the vocabulary and practicing the rules 
* Programmer proficiency is the ability to communicate intentions to a computer
* A few, if any, humans know all the words and grammar rules in a given human language
* A few programmers know all aspects of a programming language
* Not too many programmers use just one programming language through their lifetime
* Online references and self-study is a daily necessity for Information Technology hobbyists and professionals
* No one comes out of a programming course as an expert, we will learn enough to get started with JavaScript
* Programming languages change over time with newer versions released and older versions retired
* When you find a code sample online that does not work for you, it could be from a different version: newer or older
