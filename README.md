# Introduction to Front-End Development

## Overview and Objectives

Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, once said: "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches you how to think." What country? Possibly all of them.

The course will teach how to program a front-end for an application using Html, CSS, and JavaScript

There are close to [2 billion websites](https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) in the world and about [90% are using Html](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/markup_language): hypertext markup language. Everywhere you go on the Internet with a browser, whether Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, you access and interact with a website on a daily basis.

CSS is a language used to detail the presentation of a web page's markups, which means without CSS, Html websites will not be visually appealing.

JavaScript is used by almost [95% of websites](https://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/how-important-is-javascript-for-modern-web-developers-2854309b9f52) to build dynamic websites that interact with a user rather than displaying information.

JavaScript [first released in 1995 AD](https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/) and is one of the most used languages according to GitHub's statistics over the years: [https://githut.info/](https://githut.info/).

[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is a home for 40 million programmers and 100 million repositories from around the world.
