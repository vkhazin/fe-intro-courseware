# Lab: Attributes
  
* Open Google Chrome browser to [https://repl.it](https://repl.it/)

* Open the repl you have created in the previous labs

* Select `index.html` in the Files pane

* Find the table element and add an attribute [width]([https://www.w3resource.com/html/attributes/html-width-attribute.php](https://www.w3resource.com/html/attributes/html-width-attribute.php)) to it with value 100% 

* Change the value for the width attribute to see how it changes the appearance of the table

* Locate the phrase `Never Let Me Go` in the Html

* Reformat the text to turn it into an [anchor](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) or a link to this [Wikipedia article]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go_(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go_(novel)))

*  `run` the changes and validate that when you click on the text it takes you to the Wikipedia article

* Notice that the article replaces the current page, let's say we wanted to open the link in another tab or browser window

* There is an attribute for it: [target](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp)

* Update your Html and validate that the Wikipedia article opens in a new tab or browser window


*  `run` your changes to confirm the button is showing as expected
